# MP NuGetter
Creates a NuGet package for the containing Management Pack (MP) project.  Available in the [NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MPNuGetter/).

Support for consuming NuGet packages from an MP project is being added to NuGet v3.4.

This project provides a method of creating a NuGet package from an MP project, so that the MP [Bundle] may be more easily shared with development teams.

It is anticipated that NuGet command line (NuGet.exe) might be [enhanced in the future](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/1192), based on [community feedback](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4068), to obsolete this project.
