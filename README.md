# MPNuGetter
Creates a NuGet package for the containing Management Pack (MP) project.

Support for consuming NuGet packages from an MP project is being added to NuGet v3.4.

This project provides a method of creating a NuGet package from an MP project, so that the MP [Bundle] may be more easily shared with development teams.

It is anticipated that NuGet command line (NuGet.exe) might be enhanced in the future, based on community feedback, to obsolete this project.
